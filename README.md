# Wag Take Home Assignment

This project was a demonstration of my knowledge of JSON fetching and parsing, Core Data in iOS 10, and Swift. You must be running iOS 8 and have XCode 8 installed with Swift 3

To run test the project:

1. clone the repo with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/hsavit1/wag.git` - this is necessary because there is an Alamofire submodule dependency
2. open the .xcproject file
3. You need to select a team to run this project on your iphone. Note that you must have a valid Apple Developer's subscription to run the project on your iPhone device, otherwise you will only be able to run the project on the simulator. plug in your iPhone, select a team, make sure there are no build errors, and RUN.  
4. Wait for the data to load
5. turn your iphone on airplane mode
6. run the project again. this time, the project should load with the persisted data
