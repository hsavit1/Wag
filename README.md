# Wag Take Home Assignment

This project was a demonstration of my knowledge of JSON fetching and parsing, Core Data in iOS 10, and Swift

To run test the project:

1. clone the repo with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/hsavit1/wag.git` - this is necessary because there is an Alamofire submodule dependency
2. open the .xcproject file
3. You need to select a team to run this project on your iphone. plug in your iPhone, select a team, make sure there are no build errors, and RUN 
4. Wait for the data to load
5. turn your iphone on airplane mode
6. run the project again. this time, the project should load with the persisted data
